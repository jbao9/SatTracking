<strong>🛰️ Starlink </strong><br>
SpaceX is developing a low latency, broadband internet system to meet the needs of consumers across the globe. Enabled by a constellation of thousands of mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit, working in combination with ground transceivers. Here is a brief Starlink launch history, in case you are interested: 
<ul>
  <li>First Two Prototype test-flight satellites launched in Feb. 2018</li>
  <li>A second set of test satellites, and 60 operational satellites launched in May 2019</li>
  <li>As of 3 February 2022, SpaceX has launched 2,091 Starlink satellites, including demo satellites Tintin A and B</li>
  <li>In March 2022, SpaceX announced that Starlink has reached 250,000 subscribers</li>

<strong> ⚒ My Work</strong><br>
<ul>
  <li>Create-react-app and use NPM to manage project dependencies </li>
  <li>Designed and developed a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track satellites in real-time based on geo-location </li>
  <li>Built forms to collect user observation info (longitude, latitude, elevation, altitude, duration) using Ant Design component library for better user experience </li>
  <li>Achieved the core tracking functionality by fetching nearby satellites info and position prediction data through the N2YO API(s) and D3 to animate selected satellite paths on a world map</li>
